	 	Have you ever been in a place and saw some
		teenagers wearing clothes that looked so 
		familar. You think to yourself "hey I use to
		wear that style of clothes when I was their
		age!" History truly repeats itself. Trends 
		that were popular in the 50's, 60's, 70's and
		so on and so fourth, are coming back with a 
		modern spin to it. Old times are truly coming
		back.
